# 📚 Learning Lab

This repository is dedicated to storing small exercises and practice code developed during my studies in programming.

## 🎓 Academic Studies
Here you will find code written for university subjects such as:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming

## 💻 Online Courses
This repository also includes exercises and examples from online courses and platforms such as:
- DIO
- Danki Code

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to track my learning progress and keep organized notes in code form.  
These are **small practice files and exercises**, not full projects.
Complete applications and larger projects are published in separate repositories on my profile.
